Nara Wallet is an AI powered conversational wallet agent built to simplify crypto adoption and make digital asset management accessible to everyone. It is designed to work seamlessly across multiple blockchain networks including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Internet Computer, and others. Nara Wallet allows users to create wallets, send and receive funds, check balances, buy crypto with fiat, and compare market prices in real time, all through natural language interaction without the need to understand technical blockchain commands. The platform integrates a smart assistant interface where users can simply type everyday instructions such as "I want to buy Bitcoin" or "Show me my balance" and instantly get actionable results. Built on top of the Fetch.ai agent framework, Nara Wallet leverages autonomous AI agents to process requests intelligently and deliver secure, real time interaction

## üéØ Why Nara?

Nara Wallet addresses key challenges in crypto adoption:

- Global crypto holders reached **659M** in **2024**, yet only 30‚Äì60M are active monthly users **(a16z, Crypto.com)**
- **90%** of potential users admit they do not understand how to use crypto, and **49%** do not know how it works **(NCA, 2025)**
- Studies show ease of use, trust, and accessibility are the main barriers to adoption **(PMC, RIF, Nature)**

Our solution introduces an AI-powered conversational wallet agent built on Fetch.ai and internet computer protocol, enabling users to create wallets, transfer funds, check balances, buy crypto with fiat, and compare market prices across chains through simple natural language interaction.

## üèÜ Features of Nara

- **Crypto Asset Transfer**
  Send coins such as BTC, ETH, SOL, and SOL to other wallet addresses with simple chat instructions. Includes network and address validation to minimize errors.

- **Wallet Address Creation**
  The AI Agent automatically generates new wallet addresses for multiple crypto assets, ready to be used for sending and receiving.

- **Receive Crypto Assets**
  Easily request and display your wallet address so others can send you assets. Copy and share in just one click.

- **Check Wallet Balance**
  View real time balances for each asset along with basic activity history to keep track of your funds.

- **Buy Crypto (Stripe Payment)**
  Purchase coins directly through integrated payment providers without leaving the conversation. Balance updates are handled automatically after confirmation.

- **Crypto to Fiat Conversion**
  Get instant exchange rates from crypto to fiat currencies such as USD and IDR, helping users understand the real value of their holdings.

- **Cross Market Price Comparison (AI)**
  Compare coin prices across multiple sources including CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, and Coinbase. The system highlights the most competitive option in real time.

- **AI Based Best Price Recommendation**
  AI recommends the most favorable market for buying or selling coins based on live price comparison data.

### ü§ñ How the Market Price AI Works (White-Box View):

- **Real-Time Data Ingestion**: Constantly pulls live order book data and recent trade history from major exchanges (Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, etc.).
- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Extracts 30+ market microstructure features, including:

  - _Liquidity & Depth_: Volume available at different price levels.
  - _Market Volatility_: Recent price fluctuations and trade frequency.
  - _Order Book Imbalance_: Ratio of buy-to-sell pressure.
  - _Price Impact Slope_: Sensitivity of price to large orders.

- **Realistic Trade Simulation**: Builds a proprietary dataset by simulating thousands of trades under live market conditions, modeling slippage, partial fills, and exchange-specific factors.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Uses LightGBM to predict slippage percentages, highlighting the most influential features driving trade cost.

#### What the AI Prioritizes:

Our model has learned that the most critical predictors of final trade cost are:

- **Order Size (Fiat Value)** ‚Äì Larger trades relative to market depth have the strongest impact on slippage.
- **Spread Percentage** ‚Äì The gap between buy and sell prices significantly affects execution efficiency.
- **Size vs. Spread Ratio & Volatility Spread** ‚Äì How order size interacts with market volatility and spread conditions.
- **Order Book Depth** ‚Äì Availability of liquidity across different levels (e.g., top 1 level, top 10 levels, and 5‚Äì10 depth ratios).

Other factors such as trade volume, order book imbalance, and depth utilization still contribute, but with less influence compared to the above.
