## üéØ Why Nara?

Nara Wallet addresses key challenges in crypto adoption:

- Global crypto holders reached **659M** in **2024**, yet only 30‚Äì60M are active monthly users **(a16z, Crypto.com)**
- **90%** of potential users admit they do not understand how to use crypto, and **49%** do not know how it works **(NCA, 2025)**
- Studies show ease of use, trust, and accessibility are the main barriers to adoption **(PMC, RIF, Nature)**
